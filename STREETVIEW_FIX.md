# Street View Fix - Apple Maps Embedding Issue

## Problem
Apple Maps URLs cannot be embedded in iframes due to browser security restrictions, causing "Firefox Can't Open This Page" errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Placeholder Images**
- Replaced Apple Maps iframe URLs with placeholder images
- Each placeholder shows coordinates and "View on Apple Maps" text
- Uses `via.placeholder.com` service for reliable image delivery

### 2. **Apple Maps Links**
- Added clickable "üìç View on Apple Maps" links in each popup
- Links open Apple Maps in a new tab/window
- Users can view actual street-level imagery by clicking the link

### 3. **Updated Data Model**
- Added `apple_maps_link` field to Listing model
- Changed `map_type` to "placeholder" for proper rendering
- All 25 listings now have working placeholder images and Apple Maps links

## Current Implementation

### Backend Changes
```python
class Listing(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    image_url: str  # Placeholder image URL
    map_type: str = "placeholder"
    apple_maps_link: str = ""  # Apple Maps link for new tab
```

### Frontend Changes
- Placeholder images display in popups (always work)
- Clickable Apple Maps links below property details
- Error handling for failed image loads
- Clean, professional styling

## Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Always Works**: Placeholder images never fail to load
- ‚úÖ **Apple Maps Access**: Users can still view Apple Maps street view
- ‚úÖ **Professional Look**: Clean placeholder with coordinates
- ‚úÖ **No Browser Issues**: No iframe embedding problems

## Future Improvements

2. **Mapillary Integration**: Free street-level imagery service
3. **Custom Images**: Host your own property photos
4. **Apple Maps API**: If Apple releases a proper embedding API
